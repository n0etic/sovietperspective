      <p> During the Cold War, the USSR government believed that schoolchildren needed to be shown the “inevitable victory of the ideas of communism”, the “historical advantages of socialism” and other attributes of the official ideology. As a result, many events were hushed up in the textbooks, and on almost every page there were quotes from Lenin or Stalin. <br><br>After the USSR collapsed, Russia officially banned the imposition of ideology and, gradually, new textbooks began to be published. This resulted in the same historical events being portrayed very differently in the textbooks written for different generations of schoolchildren in Soviet Union and Russia. This page examines textbooks written in three time periods: 60-80s USSR, 90s Russia, and modern Russia of 2021.</p>

      <h2> THE KOREAN WAR</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="section-text" >
      <p>The Korean War (1950-1953) was a military conflict between the South Korean government supported by the United Nations (with the US in the lead), and the communist government in the North supported by China and the Soviet Union. It is often described as an important episode in the early Cold War, and as the first proxy war between the “Free World” and the Eastern bloc. <br><br>Casualties, wounded, and missing from the war totaled more than two million on all sides, and resulted in the split of the Korean peninsula into two states with two separate governments: the Republic of Korea in the South, and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea in the North. The 1953 Armistice Agreement established the Korean Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) that roughly divides the Korean peninsula in half, and serves as a buffer zone between North Korea and South Korea. No peace treaty exists between the two states.</p>

  <h2> Berlin Wall</h2>
</div>

<div class="section-text" >
  <p>The Berlin Wall (1961-1989) was a guarded, concrete wall between West Berlin (controlled by the Western Allies) and East Berlin (the Soviet sector of Berlin and the capital of East Germany). It was constructed by East Germany, officially known as the German Democratic Republic, and was described by its government as a barrier protecting its people from “fascist elements.” The Berlin Wall closed off the population flow between East Germany and West Germany. Between 1949 and 1961 about 2.5 million East Germans had fled to the West. By the 1980s the Wall, including electrified fences and fortifications, extended 28 miles (45 km) through Berlin and a further 75 miles (120 km) around West Berlin. It came to physically symbolize the Iron Curtain that separated Western Europe and the Eastern Bloc during the Cold War. The Berlin Wall was demolished in 1989 as a result of the wave of democratization in East Europe, and was followed by the unification of Germany in 1990.</p>

<p>The late Cold War is characterized by a thaw in relations between the US and Soviet Union in the late 1980s, and mostly associated with the figure of Mikhail Gorbachev and his perestroika reforms in the Soviet Union. In the 1980's, Gorbachev and Reagan conducted a number of summits that led to the reduction of the two superpowers' nuclear arsenals. In 1989, Soviet forces withdrew from Afghanistan, and the revolutionary wave in East Europe replaced communist-backed governments and Soviet allies. At the Malta summit in December 1989, Gorbachev and US President George H.W. Bush declared the end of the Cold War. The next year, the Soviet Union consented to the reunification of Germany. In 1991, the Soviet Union broke up into 15 independent states.</p>
